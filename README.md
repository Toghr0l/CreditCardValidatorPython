# CreditCardValidatorPython
This code checks if a credit card number is valid using the Luhn algorithm. The user is prompted to enter a credit card number, which is then processed by removing any spaces or dashes and reversing the order of the digits. The script then calculates the sum of the odd and even digits, with the even digits being doubled and their individual digits summed if the result is greater than 10. The total sum of the odd and even digits is then calculated and checked to see if it is divisible by 10. If it is, the credit card number is considered valid and “Valid” is printed to the screen. Otherwise, “InValid” is printed.
